Canvas: 1080x1350 portrait (4:5) educational carousel slide.
ABSOLUTE BOUNDARY: every element fully inside the 1080x1350 canvas — nothing bleeds or clips past edges.
Safe margin ≥6% all sides. Reduce/drop content rather than clip.
{carousel_color_rules}
Soft ULTRA-PREMIUM HD clay-3D icons (4K-sharp studio product renders, strong shadows — NOT flat, NOT blurry, NOT low-poly).
Text must render as clean printed sans-serif, not embossed, not glowing, not outlined, not metallic.

SLIDE ANATOMY — TEXT DOMINANT:
1. TOP-RIGHT CORNER: leave it COMPLETELY BLANK — solid background colour only, zero elements. NEVER draw a logo, wordmark, leaf icon, compass icon, circular badge, brand symbol, decorative icon, or ANY graphic in the top-right. Brand logo is composited in post-processing. This corner must be 100% empty.
2. MANDATORY UNIQUE headline at top-left on EVERY slide — never omit, never repeat topic title.
3. Supporting line with mechanism or real number (required).
4. DEPTH BLOCK (REQUIRED, ~35–45% of slide height): max TWO cards with soft shadow.

5. ICONS/AVATARS: premium HD 3D object (~12–16% height) bottom-right — {carousel_icon_hint}. NEVER omit. NEVER giant hero.

ABSOLUTE BOUNDARY: every element fully inside the 1080x1350 canvas — nothing bleeds or clips past edges.
Safe margin ≥6% all sides. Reduce/drop content rather than clip.
Background: Soft off-white {self.INFO_BG}.
Style: Clean, scannable, premium fintech — LIKE the Jiraaf samples (ranking bars / hub facts / % ranks).
Typography: Bold navy headings; short labels; ALL copy baked into pixels.

CHOOSE LAYOUT BY TOPIC (pick ONE — do not invent essay grids):
A) TRADE DEFICIT / EXPORT–IMPORT DATA BOARD (India–Russia sample — when user asks trade deficit):
   - Punchy data headline + one factual subtitle
   - Column headers: EXPORT | TRADE BALANCE | IMPORT (Billion USD)
   - Year rows with orange export bars LEFT, blue import bars RIGHT, balance numbers CENTER
   - Bottom box: "What India buys most from Russia" with category + USD amounts
   - Source footer (Ministry of Commerce…)
   - NO clay FD briefcase, NO Capital Preservation / Regular Income / bond cards, NO investment CTAs
B) EDUCATION / WHY / BENEFITS (ONLY when user asks why / useful / predictable income / explain):
   - Hero clay-3D icon + 3–5 BENEFIT/REASON cards — NOT trade tables
C) RANKING LIST (ONLY if user asked top-N / FDI / country-wise ranks):
   - Vertical ranked rows: flag/icon + NAME + bar + % + metric
D) HUB + SHORT FACTS (ONLY bank penalties / key rules):
   - Center hub + 4–5 bank fact cards

POSTER RULES:
1. TOP-RIGHT CORNER: leave COMPLETELY BLANK — background colour only. NEVER draw logo, wordmark, leaf, compass, circular badge, decorative icon, or ANY graphic here. Real Jiraaf logo is composited in post.
2. Prefer short labels over paragraphs. If blueprint has long body, IGNORE it visually.
3. Brand colours REQUIRED: navy {self.NAVY} + visible orange accents {self.ORANGE}
{ORANGE_COVERAGE_LOCK}
   (section dashes, highlight bars, CTA arrows, dividers). Never navy-only.
4. Trade boards = flat bars + typography. Soft matte clay-3D ONLY for education/hub — never on trade tables.
5. Bake exact approved short strings; spelling must be PERFECT — zero typos.
6. NEVER invent bond/FD benefit cards for a trade-deficit topic.
7. Currency: USD labeled for trade boards; ₹ for India retail topics.
8. No textbook essay paragraphs. COMPLETE SENTENCES — never cut off mid-word or mid-sentence.
9. No empty shells. No purple AI aesthetic.
10. CARD TEXT FULLY VISIBLE — reduce font size if needed; never clip or hide text.

CANVAS BOUNDARY LOCK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Canvas: {canvas} (1080×1350 vertical).
ABSOLUTE BOUNDARY: Every pixel inside the canvas. Outer safe margin ≥8% on ALL sides.
Content that does not fit must be shortened or dropped — never clip.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LOCKED VISUAL SYSTEM (PREMIUM AGENCY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
BACKGROUND: solid very pale blue {self.CAROUSEL_BG} only. Soft vignette/particles almost invisible.
NO full-page heavy gradients. NO PowerPoint / Canva look.
Colors: navy titles {self.CAROUSEL_NAVY}; body gray {self.BODY_GRAY}; orange accents {self.CAROUSEL_ORANGE}
ONLY for numbers/key words/tiny CTA/icons — never overuse.
Wide rounded soft-blue #DDEFF9 info cards (3D isometric icon left, thin divider, text right), tiny soft depth.
Icons: Pixar-quality photoreal 3D (glass/ceramic/chrome) — NO flat icons, NO emoji, NO text baked inside icons.
Typography: Extra Bold UPPERCASE navy headline ≤12 words; body ≤20 words / max 2 lines. Perfect spelling.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
LOCKED LAYOUT (TOP → BOTTOM)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1) TOP-RIGHT: empty logo pocket (~24% wide × ~12% tall) — NEVER draw logo/wordmark/"{brand_name}"/JIRAAF letters.
2) HEADLINE: Extra Bold navy UPPERCASE — max 12 words — never cut mid-word.
3) SUPPORTING LINE: one short subhead.
4) Hero 3D visual (storytelling object — coins/graphs/shield/docs/lock).
5) 3–4 wide rounded soft-blue info cards (icon left → divider → short text right).
6) Tiny takeaway ABOVE footer zone.
7) FOOTER SAFE ZONE (MANDATORY EVERY SLIDE): leave bottom ~14% EMPTY pale-blue —
   do NOT bake SEBI/legal text (exact disclaimer Pillow-composited after).
8) CTA: ONLY if provided on closing slide — compact orange pill ≤28% width ≤4.5% height 2–4 words.
   NEVER invent CTAs. NEVER bake CTA/icon gibberish text.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Background solid {self.CAROUSEL_BG} — identical slide-to-slide. NEVER black/charcoal.
2. Pixar-quality 3D icons; leave SEBI disclaimer zone empty.
3. Bake ONLY quoted copy letter-perfect — no mid-word cuts; no invented CTA/icon text.
4. Hierarchy: headline → hero 3D → cards → takeaway → empty disclaimer zone.
5. No flat clipart. No neon AI look. No watermark.
6. NEVER draw logos or brand-name text — top-right pocket only.
7. ALWAYS leave bottom for SEBI disclaimer composite — carousel always needs disclaimer.
