- NOT low-poly. NOT flat clipart. NOT cheap toy blobs. NOT washed-out soft mush. NOT neon/chrome AI junk.
- NOT blurry, NOT out-of-focus, NOT low-res — icons must read crisp at 100% zoom.
- Soft keyed studio lighting (top-left key + gentle fill); deep soft contact shadows; clear depth.
- TOPIC LOCK: choose objects from the user's topic ONLY.

  * trade deficit / imports-exports -> bars, containers, arrows, balance, table markers
  * bonds / fixed income -> bond certificate, coupon slip, wallet, chart, rupee coin
- Do NOT default to FD briefcase, handshake, bond certificate, or bank icons for unrelated topics.
- Palette: navy {JIRAAF_NAVY}, gold/amber {JIRAAF_GOLD}, orange {JIRAAF_ORANGE}, warm neutral accents.
- SIZE: SMALL–MEDIUM so text/paragraphs stay readable — static/infographic icons ~8–11% of

- Clay-3D icons (Section 2 + hero): keep the 3D form but colour the surfaces in FULLY SATURATED navy/
  orange/gold — avoid heavy shadow or desaturating ambient occlusion that makes them look gray/dull.

2) NO overlapping: text never overlaps icons, icons never overlap text, rows never collide, chips never collide.
3) NO cut-off: headlines, supporting lines, row facts, chip labels, CTA buttons, source lines — fully visible.
4) Prefer LESS content that fits over MORE content that breaks. Drop optional body/CTA before clipping.

8) Icons: sized to leave clear breathing room around nearby text; never crush labels.
9) Spelling perfect — never invent broken words (technology not tecnlogy; real estate not restate).

- static_hub_facts → hub + 5 bank fact cards (sample_bank_penalties.png)

DATA POST vs TEASER vs EDUCATION

If user asks WHY / useful / benefits / explain / how / what is:
→ INFOGRAPHIC: multi-section editorial (section headings + 3-col icon cards + callout box)
→ STATIC: simple hero + 3–5 heading/explanation cards
→ FORBIDDEN: bond benefit cards (Capital Preservation / Regular Income) on unrelated topics
→ FORBIDDEN: invent India vs USA vs Germany yield boards unless user asked compare/rank

If user asks rates / rules / top-N / comparison / FDI / inflation / bank penalties:
→ Put ACTUAL facts in sections/slides. NO curiosity-only teasers. NO fake testimonials replacing data.

TOPIC LOCK (HARD FAIL — read before using any example below):
The examples in this document exist to show SHAPE only. Every headline, entity,
phrase, statistic and CTA you emit must come from the user's own topic and this
run's research. Reusing an example's subject matter or wording is a rejection.
If the user asked about airports, nothing about FDI/countries/banks/bonds may appear.

BAD SHAPE: teaser question + "Learn more" + fake quote, with none of the actual rates
BAD SHAPE: a country/yield comparison board when the user asked neither compare nor rank
BAD SHAPE: hub-spoke collage with "Web Search:" labels + truncated text + missing logo
GOOD SHAPE: plain claim headline + 4–5 fact cards, each carrying a real ₹/% figure
GOOD SHAPE: ranked rows with flag + ≤5-word phrase + amount (only when top-N was asked)
GOOD SHAPE: storytelling editorial — hook → scale → why → effect → takeaway (why/how topics)
